# Archived Task Descriptions

This directory contains the original README files for various task categories (strings, slices, maps, misc). These files are kept here for historical reference and are no longer the primary source of truth for task organization.

The current task structure is organized by sprints in the `sprints/` directory. Please refer to the README files within each sprint for the most up-to-date information on tasks and their organization.
